# Tasks to do

A global task moves to [[tasks-done-index]] when it is done or cancelled (`vault/scripts/task-status.js` does it). A global waiting for the owner stays here as `Status wait-answers.`; its node's `waiting_for` says what it waits for.

## Relations
- [[tasks-index]] — parent index.


- [[task-473-miner-light-calibration]] — The miner light colour, intensity and pool size are tuned in game until the light around the miner matches the warm orange-pink pool of owner image 2. Status todo.
